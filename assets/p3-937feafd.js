The goal of this studio was to articulate design proposals that fulfill the different performative criteria of the contemporary high-rise while also contesting its presumed identity. This proposal is for a 20-story high-rise, situated adjacent to Highline Park in New York City. The form of the tower was reached through a formal exploration into ‘profiling’ where two corners of the tower remain vertical, while the remaining two corners follow a more expressive vertical path."},i=[e.jsx("section",{})];function n(){return e.jsx(t,{i:3,details:o,sections:i})}export{n as default};
