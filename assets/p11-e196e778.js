Its ambition is to evolve the industry standard of manually tracking and diagramming program data. This work also reveals how formatting program data in a standard fashion can enable architects to utilize other interdisciplinary tools such as a bioinformatics platform like Cytoscape to visualize the complex networks of relationships that underpin the programming and space planning effort of large architectural projects like stadiums, hospitals, and airports.
