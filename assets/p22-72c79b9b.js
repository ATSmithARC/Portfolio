In addition to the C# object library, StadiumTools has been implemented into a Grasshopper Plugin and a forthcoming Revit Addon. StadiumTools accelerates the iterative process of stadium bowl design and implements several novel features for developing seating bowl geometries from irregular plan configurations."},i=[e.jsx("section",{})];function n(){return e.jsx(o,{i:22,details:t,sections:i})}export{n as default};
