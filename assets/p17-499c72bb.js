Several concepts were introduced such as circular assemblies, robotic fabrication, and wood forming through programmed material behavior. With an iterative approach, we experimented with various digital designs and physical prototypes where material, form, and structure were all open to investigation."},i=[e.jsx("section",{})];function s(){return e.jsx(a,{i:17,details:o,sections:i})}export{s as default};
