These included research,  analysis, and representation of topics of site, context, program, and precedent. The project is a roughly 1,000sqm after-school facility for children and young adults located at the busy intersection of Hollywood Blvd. and Vine Street. In the case of this project, a rigorous precedent study of the Igualada Cemetary in Spain inspired many of the formal, spatial, and circulatory qualities found in the final projectâ€™s design."},a=[e.jsx("section",{})];function r(){return e.jsx(t,{i:1,details:o,sections:a})}export{r as default};
