The focus of this workshop was on the structural mechanics and architectural principles of both reciprocal frame and grid shell structures, as well as methods of generating, relaxing, and optimizing FE models of both structural systems using Rhino+Grasshopper and Revit+Dynamo. One and a half days of instruction and computational design was followed by an equal period of fabrication wherein a group-generated computational model was used to fabricate two long-span, self-supporting structures, built from locally acquired wood laminate."},a=[o.jsx("section",{})];function n(){return o.jsx(t,{i:8,details:e,sections:a})}export{n as default};
