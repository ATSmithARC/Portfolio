Dodger’s Stadium, opened in 1962, and built on forcibly taken land, is currently surrounded by roughly 2,000 sqm. surface-level parking. Used only on game-days, this land has increasingly been the subject of prospective development plans. With that history in mind, this project reimagines a portion of this prime real estate as a master-planned, mixed-use, and mid-rise residential community that formally and operationally identifies as an extension of the existing ballpark’s outfield."},n=[e.jsx("section",{})];function r(){return e.jsx(t,{i:7,details:i,sections:n})}export{r as default};
