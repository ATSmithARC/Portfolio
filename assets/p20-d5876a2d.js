This project in particular focused on pushing the limits of the existing methodology introduced in the workshop by exploring the implications of diagonal loading (loads with both vertical & horizontal components). An initial design was developed first using simulations, then prototype panels were CNC-knit, loaded, and compared with the simulated model. The model was then tuned based on the prototypes’ behaviors, and a final set of 6 panels were knitted and installed."},o=[e.jsx("section",{})];function l(){return e.jsx(t,{i:20,details:i,sections:o})}export{l as default};
