The studio emphasized that the formal choices we make as architects impact a range of behavioral outcomes that a building can invoke. The program developed for this project focused on teaching and celebrating the cultural importance of street food, home cooking, and other informal cuisines within the multi-ethnic context of downtown Los Angeles. The architectural result was a serrated tower that acted as part museum, part culinary school, and part market."},o=[t.jsx("section",{})];function s(){return t.jsx(e,{i:2,details:a,sections:o})}export{s as default};
