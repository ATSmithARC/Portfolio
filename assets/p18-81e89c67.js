The purpose of this project was to test the limits of the space frame system by exploring the integration of actuating struts and omnidirectional nodes that together drive a passive, mechanical response to changes in ambient temperature and solar radiation. Two large-scale prototypes were fabricated and sensed to understand and measure the performance and physical behavior of the PTASF system."},s=[e.jsx("section",{})];function n(){return e.jsx(a,{i:18,details:t,sections:s})}export{n as default};
