OpenMaterialData aimed to solve issues with existing EPD databases by providing an alternative to a patchwork of proprietary data exposure services and by improving data quality by replacing inconsistent proprietary data standards with an open standard. OpenMaterialData proposed and prototyped an open-source distributed database architecture that can meet our industry’s demand for comprehensive, transparent, and standardized digital product data."},r=[a.jsx("section",{})];function s(){return a.jsx(t,{i:21,details:e,sections:r})}export{s as default};
