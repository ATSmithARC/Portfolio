The ambition of Hacking Fracking is to solve three problems facing the state’s hydrology: Aquifer depletion, worsening hydraulic extremes (droughts & floods), and widespread hydraulic fracturing by the oil and gas industry. This project exploits technical similarities between hydraulic fracturing wells and aquifer injection & recharge wells in order to propose how we can and must re-purpose Texas’ 430,000+ active and abandoned fracking wells into a decentralized state-wide aquifer storage, filtration, recovery, and groundwater quality monitoring network."},o=[e.jsx("section",{})];function s(){return e.jsx(r,{i:10,details:i,sections:o})}export{s as default};
