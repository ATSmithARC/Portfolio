At the time of this project, details of SFMOMA were not available, so the study was conducted through a combination of studying publicly available construction photos and taking notes of mockups on display at the Encols office in Los Angeles. As part of this project, a detailed 3D model was constructed to represent our understanding of the building’s exterior assembly. The exercise finished with an attempt to re-image the facade by detailing a completely different system in place of the existing one."},s=[e.jsx("section",{})];function r(){return e.jsx(t,{i:4,details:o,sections:s})}export{r as default};
