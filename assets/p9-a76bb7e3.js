The focus of the workshop was presenting topological optimization workflows of shell structures using Altair’s OptiStruct Software. Specifically, we explored several processes of translating a 2D mesh-edge network into a 3D shell using a mesh relaxation technique. The relaxed 3D meshes then underwent several discretization and sub-division routines to prepare them for FE analysis in Optistruct. Throughout the workshop, we were able to work between Optistruct and Grasshopper with the help of a proprietary Rhino plugin that supported Optistruct’s data types."},s=[e.jsx("section",{})];function n(){return e.jsx(t,{i:9,details:o,sections:s})}export{n as default};
