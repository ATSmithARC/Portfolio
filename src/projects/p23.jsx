PLANimal explores how open-source geospatial ecological data can be accessibly generated, queried, structured, and ultimately drive early-stage conceptual design decisions by leveraging the collective specialist knowledge of citizens, scientists, and designers. Based on Animal-Aided-Design and Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design principles."
