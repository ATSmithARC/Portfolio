      "Hi, I'm Andrew Smith. I’m a multidisciplinary designer bridging between the fields of architecture, computation, and application development. I have a combined 10 years of academic and professional experience in architecture, in which I hold a <a target='_blank' title='See Program Page' class='custom-underline'href='https://www.sciarc.edu/academics/undergraduate'>B.Arch</a> & <a target='_blank' title='See Program Page' class='custom-underline'href='https://royaldanishacademy.com/master-computation-in-architecture'>MA</a> degree. I'm passionate about design, technology, and really anything to do with putting things together.",
      "Early in my studies, I grew a passion for using programming and scripting as design tools. Later, in practice, I found immense value in applying these tools (and computational thinking in general) toward solving process-based challenges on projects like ",
      ". At HKS Architects, I worked with teams of all shapes and sizes on dozens of projects primarily in the sports/venues sector. These projects ranged from quick week-long design proposals to multi-year construction administration assistance.",
      "Now, having recently graduated from the Computation in Architecture MA program at the Royal Danish Academy, I’m actively developing several applications including ",
      ". These projects help keep me up-to-date with new tools, libraries, and frameworks.",
      "I'm also seeking a full-time position to leverage my computational and development skills on innovative projects. So, whether it's an employment inquiry, collaborating on a project, discussing app ideas, or simply saying hi, feel free to reach out, and let's put something amazing together!"
