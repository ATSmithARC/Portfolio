# My Portfolio in React

This project contains source code for a simple web portfolio built using the React framework. I develop and host the development version of the site using the Glitch IDE.
The production version of this site exists at [atsmitharc.com](https://www.atsmitharc.com)

The media content for the webpage is hosted on Google S3 Cloud Storage.
