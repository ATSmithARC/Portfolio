# A Static Portfolio App Built w/ React

This repo contains source code for my personal web portfolio.

It's developed with the React library and built with Vite.

The build files are hosted from the gh-pages branch of this repo on a custom domain.

You can visit the built site here: [atsmitharc.com](https://www.atsmitharc.com)

The media content for the webpage is self-hosted on my own Google S3 Bucket.

There are many things I'd like to improve, but for now it works :)
